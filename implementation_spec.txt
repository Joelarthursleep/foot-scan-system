📊 Module 2: Temporal Comparison Enhanced System2.1 Health Trajectory Prediction EnginePurpose: Analyse longitudinal scan data and predict future health scores using multiple regression models with automatic model selection.Regression Models ImplementationModel 1: Linear Regression

Equation: y = mx + b
Best for: Steady, consistent decline or improvement
Interpretation: Constant rate of change
Use case: Stable chronic conditions, consistent management
Model 2: Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)

Equation: y = ax² + bx + c
Best for: Accelerating or decelerating decline
Interpretation: Rate of change is changing
Use case: Progressive conditions, intervention effects
Model 3: Exponential Decay

Equation: y = a × e^(bx) + c
Best for: Rapid initial decline that stabilises
Interpretation: Severity-dependent decline rate
Use case: Acute conditions becoming chronic, surgical recovery
Model Selection CriteriaAutomatic Best Model Selection:

Calculate R² (coefficient of determination) for all three models
Select model with highest R² value
Minimum R² threshold: 0.70 for reliable prediction
If all models <0.70, flag as "Insufficient data for reliable prediction"
R² Interpretation:

0.90-1.00: Excellent fit, highly reliable predictions
0.80-0.89: Good fit, reliable predictions
0.70-0.79: Acceptable fit, predictions with caution
<0.70: Poor fit, predictions unreliable
Prediction SpecificationsForecast Horizon: 24 months forward from most recent scanOutput Requirements:

Month-by-month predicted scores (24 data points)
95% confidence intervals for each prediction
Model statistics (R², standard error, trend direction)
Uncertainty quantification increasing with time horizon
Confidence Interval Calculation:

Use ±1.96 × standard error for 95% CI
Standard error increases with distance from known data points
Display as shaded area on visualisation
Trend Direction Classification:

Declining: Slope <-0.5 points/month
Stable: Slope -0.5 to +0.5 points/month
Improving: Slope >+0.5 points/month
Months to Threshold CalculationPrimary Threshold: Health score = 60 (Risk threshold)
Secondary Threshold: Health score = 40 (Critical threshold)Calculation Method:

Iterate through monthly predictions
Identify first month where predicted score < 60
If already below 60, calculate months to score < 40
If improving trajectory, report "N/A - trajectory improving"
Result Interpretation:

<6 months: Immediate intervention imperative
6-12 months: Urgent preventive action needed
12-24 months: Preventive measures recommended


24 months: Standard monitoring appropriate


Never reaches threshold: Positive prognosis with current management

2.2 Condition Progression Analysis SystemPurpose: Track how individual conditions evolve across multiple scans to identify worsening, improving, or stable patterns.Progression Tracking MethodologyData Requirements:

Minimum 2 scans to establish progression
Optimal: 3+ scans for reliable trend analysis
Each scan must have: date, condition detected (yes/no), severity level, confidence score
Severity Scoring System:

Mild: 1 point
Moderate: 2 points
Severe: 3 points
Change Score Calculation:

Formula: Current severity score - Initial severity score
Range: -2 (improved from severe to mild) to +2 (worsened from mild to severe)
Normalise by time: Monthly rate = Change score / Months elapsed
Progression ClassificationWorsening:

Criteria: Change score >+0.5 OR severity increased by 1+ level
Significance: High priority for intervention
Display: Red indicator, upward arrow
Clinical action: Review treatment efficacy, consider escalation
Improving:

Criteria: Change score <-0.5 OR severity decreased by 1+ level
Significance: Treatment effective
Display: Green indicator, downward arrow
Clinical action: Continue current protocol, document successful intervention
Stable:

Criteria: Change score between -0.5 and +0.5, no severity level change
Significance: Condition controlled
Display: Yellow indicator, horizontal arrow
Clinical action: Maintain current management
Fluctuating:

Criteria: Severity changes up and down across scans (inconsistent pattern)
Significance: Condition variability, possible compliance issues
Display: Orange indicator, wavy arrow
Clinical action: Investigate variability causes, improve compliance
Progression Path VisualisationPath String Format:

Show severity at each scan date
Example: "Mild (Jan 2024) → Moderate (Apr 2024) → Severe (Jul 2024)"
Include scan dates for context
Colour code each severity level in display
Overall Progression Risk AssessmentCalculate Across All Conditions:

Count: How many conditions worsening, improving, stable
Weight by severity: Worsening severe condition = higher risk
Consider rate of change: Rapid worsening = higher risk
Risk Categories:

High Progression Risk: 2+ conditions worsening OR any condition worsening rapidly (>1 severity level in <6 months)
Moderate Progression Risk: 1 condition worsening OR multiple stable with concerning trend
Low Progression Risk: No worsening conditions, some improving
Stable/Improving: Majority of conditions stable or improving

Clinical significance: Fall prevention protocol essential, assistive device consideration
Very High Risk Zone (Red):

Fall risk: >40%
Insurance implications: Major premium adjustment (1.9-3.0x), long-term care insurance likely declined or restricted
Clinical significance: Urgent intervention, mobility aids essential, supervised ambulation
Insurance Underwriting ImplicationsLife Insurance:

Low risk: No impact on approval or rates
Moderate risk: Standard rates, may require medical exam
High risk: Rated policy (higher premiums), additional medical documentation
Very High risk: May be declined or heavily rated
Health Insurance:

Low risk: Standard rates
Moderate risk: Minor adjustment, increased claim reserve
High risk: Higher premiums, pre-existing condition considerations
Very High risk: Significant premium increase, possible coverage limitations
Long-term Care Insurance:

Low risk: Standard underwriting
Moderate risk: Higher premiums (15-30% increase)
High risk: Significantly higher premiums (40-80% increase) or benefit period restrictions
Very High risk: Often declined, or offered with very high premiums and limited benefits
Claim Likelihood Estimates:
Based on fall risk category, provide 5-year claim probability:

Low risk: 5-10% probability of fall-related claim
Moderate risk: 15-25% probability
High risk: 30-50% probability
Very High risk: >50% probability
Risk Trajectory AnalysisWorsening Risk Trajectory:

Fall risk increased by >10 percentage points from baseline
Monthly increase rate >1 percentage point
Implications: Aggressive intervention needed, insurance implications significant
Stable Risk:
